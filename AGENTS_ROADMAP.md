# Sentinel Agents Roadmap

This document tracks ideas for future Sentinel agents. Agents extend Sentinel's capabilities through the [Agent Protocol](https://sentinel.raskell.io/docs/agent-protocol/).

## Architecture: Built-in vs Agent

Sentinel follows a **"boring dataplane, innovative agents"** philosophy:

**Built-in to Sentinel Core** (stable, bounded, predictable):
- Rate limiting (local + distributed)
- Load balancing (multiple algorithms)
- Circuit breakers
- Health checks + target ejection
- HTTP caching
- CORS handling
- GeoIP filtering
- TLS/mTLS termination
- Service discovery
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Traffic mirroring
- Static file serving
- Header manipulation
- Body decompression/compression

**Agents** (out-of-process, extensible, isolated):
- Authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
- WAF / attack detection
- Custom business logic
- Complex transformations
- Protocol-specific security (GraphQL, gRPC, MQTT)
- Scripting (Lua, JavaScript, WebAssembly)

This separation keeps the dataplane safe and bounded while allowing complex, potentially risky features to be isolated and independently upgraded.

| [ModSecurity](https://sentinel.raskell.io/agents/modsec/) | Beta | Full OWASP CRS with 800+ rules |
| [AI Gateway](https://sentinel.raskell.io/agents/ai-gateway/) | Beta | LLM guardrails (input/output) |
| [WebSocket Inspector](https://sentinel.raskell.io/agents/websocket-inspector/) | Beta | WebSocket frame security |
| [Lua](https://sentinel.raskell.io/agents/lua/) | Beta | Lua scripting |
| [JavaScript](https://sentinel.raskell.io/agents/js/) | Beta | JavaScript scripting (QuickJS) |
| [WebAssembly](https://sentinel.raskell.io/agents/wasm/) | Beta | High-performance Wasm modules |
| [Bot Management](https://sentinel.raskell.io/agents/bot-management/) | Beta | Multi-signal bot detection with behavioral analysis |

## Planned Agents

### Priority 1: High Value

#### GraphQL Security
**Status:** Proposed
**Complexity:** Medium
**Value:** High

GraphQL-specific security controls.

**Features:**
- [ ] Query depth limiting
- [ ] Query complexity analysis (cost calculation)
- [ ] Field-level authorization
- [ ] Introspection control (disable in production)
- [ ] Batch query limits
- [ ] Alias limits
- [ ] Persisted queries / allowlist mode
- [ ] N+1 detection

**Use Cases:**
- Prevent resource exhaustion from deep/complex queries
- Field-level access control
- Production hardening

---

#### Request/Response Transform
**Status:** Proposed
**Complexity:** Medium
**Value:** Medium

Advanced request and response transformation beyond built-in capabilities.

> **Note:** Sentinel core includes basic header manipulation (`set`/`add`/`remove` for request and response headers) and body decompression. This agent would provide **advanced** transformations.

**Features:**
- [ ] Complex URL rewriting (regex-based, with capture groups)
- [ ] Body transformation (JSON path manipulation, jq-style queries)
- [ ] XML/HTML body transformation
- [ ] Request/response cloning for A/B testing
- [ ] Conditional transforms (based on JWT claims, custom logic)
- [ ] Template-based responses (Handlebars, Tera)
- [ ] Content-Type conversion (JSON ↔ XML)

**Use Cases:**
- API migration (legacy URL support with complex rewrites)
- Response shaping for different clients
- Backend response normalization
- GraphQL-to-REST bridging

---

### Priority 2: Observability

#### Audit Logger
**Status:** Proposed
**Complexity:** Low
**Value:** Medium

Structured compliance-focused audit logging.

**Features:**
- [ ] Configurable log fields
- [ ] Multiple output formats (JSON, CEF, LEEF)
- [ ] Log shipping (file, syslog, HTTP, Kafka)
- [ ] PII redaction in logs
- [ ] Request/response body logging (configurable)
- [ ] Compliance templates (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI)

**Use Cases:**
- Security audit trails
- Compliance requirements
- Incident investigation

---

### Priority 3: Compliance & Data

#### Data Masking
**Status:** Proposed
**Complexity:** High
**Value:** Medium

PII protection and data minimization.

**Features:**
- [ ] Field-level tokenization
- [ ] Format-preserving encryption
- [ ] Regex-based detection and masking
- [ ] Header value masking
- [ ] Request body field masking
- [ ] Response body field masking
- [ ] Reversible vs irreversible masking

**Use Cases:**
- GDPR compliance
- PCI DSS (card data protection)
- Secure logging
- Data minimization

---

### Priority 4: Protocol-Specific

#### gRPC Inspector
**Status:** Proposed
**Complexity:** High
**Value:** Medium

gRPC/Protocol Buffers security.

**Features:**
- [ ] Method-level authorization
- [ ] Message size limits
- [ ] Metadata inspection
- [ ] Rate limiting per method
- [ ] Schema validation
- [ ] Reflection control

**Use Cases:**
- gRPC API security
- Service mesh integration
- Internal API governance

---

#### MQTT Gateway
**Status:** Proposed
**Complexity:** High
**Value:** Low-Medium

IoT protocol security.

- [ ] Topic-based ACLs
- [ ] Payload inspection
- [ ] Client authentication
- [ ] Message rate limiting
- [ ] QoS enforcement

### Priority 5: Developer Experience

#### Mock Server
**Status:** Proposed

- [ ] Static response stubs
- [ ] Dynamic responses (templates)
- [ ] Latency simulation
- [ ] Failure injection
- [ ] Record and replay mode

**Use Cases:**

- [ ] Sunset date headers
- [ ] Usage tracking for deprecated endpoints
- [ ] Automatic redirects to new versions
- [ ] Migration documentation links
